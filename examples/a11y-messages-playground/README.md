# A11y × Messages Playground

A focused hub playground for testing **[`@devframes/plugin-a11y`](../../plugins/a11y)**
alongside **[`@devframes/plugin-messages`](../../plugins/messages)** — and, above
all, the **message → dock navigation** they share.

Where [`minimal-vite-devframe-hub`](../minimal-vite-devframe-hub) mounts every
built-in plugin against the hub's own (mostly accessible) UI, this example ships a
deliberately **inaccessible, multi-route app under test** so the a11y scanner
always has real violations to find, track per route, and link back to from the
messages feed.

## Run it

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --filter a11y-messages-playground dev
```

The `dev` script builds the workspace first (the a11y agent bundle and both
plugin SPAs must exist), then starts Vite bound to `0.0.0.0`. Open the printed
URL.

## What you'll see

The window is split in two:

- **Left — App under test.** A tiny client-side-routed app whose every route is
  broken on purpose:
  - `/` — a missing `alt`, an icon-only button, an empty link, a skipped heading
    level
  - `/images` — a gallery of `alt`-less images
  - `/forms` — inputs and a select with no labels
  - `/contrast` — low-contrast text and a custom control with no accessible name
- **Right — Devtools.** The **A11y Inspector** and **Messages** docks.

## What to try

1. **Live scanning** — open the **A11y Inspector**. It scans the left pane on
   load; the Dashboard shows the totals and severity breakdown.
2. **Route tracking** — click the route tabs in the app under test (`Home`,
   `Images`, `Forms`, `Contrast`). Each navigation is a `history.pushState`,
   which the agent patches — the Violations tab accrues one group per route.
3. **Select + highlight** — hover a violation to ring the element in the page;
   tick a violation's checkbox to highlight all its elements with numbered
   badges, then hit **Generate fix prompts** in the nav for a paste-ready AI
   prompt covering everything you selected.
4. **Message → dock navigation** *(the headline)* — open the **Messages** dock.
   Each scan mirrors a summary entry plus one entry per violated rule, and every
   entry carries a navigation action. Select an entry and click **View in a11y
   inspector** (or **Open a11y dashboard**): the hub switches the focused dock to
   the A11y Inspector, deep-linked to that rule + route, and pins the offending
   elements.

## How it's wired

`src/a11y-messages-playground.ts` is the whole host — a ~120-line Vite plugin
that runs `@devframes/hub` in the dev server, mounts the two plugins as docks,
and attaches the a11y agent as the a11y dock's `clientScript`:

```ts
a11yMessagesPlayground({
  devframes: [a11yDevframe, messagesDevframe],
  clientScripts: {
    [a11yDevframe.id]: { importFrom: `/@fs/${a11yAgentBundlePath}` },
  },
})
```

`src/client/main.ts` boots the hub's client runtime with
`createDevframeClientHost()`, which imports that agent into the host page (so it
scans the app under test) and renders the dock rail from `devframe:docks` shared
state. The navigation itself rides existing hub primitives: the messages panel
calls `hub:docks:activate`, the hub broadcasts it, and the client host switches
the focused dock — the same path a manual dock click takes.
